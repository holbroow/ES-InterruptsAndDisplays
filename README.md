# InterruptsAndDisplays
CODAL build tools for the micro:bit with my own program, ready to be built and flashed.

ALL CODE ASIDE FROM THE CW3.cpp IN microbit-v2-samples/source IS WORK OF VARIOUS MICROBIT DEVELOPERS AND RESEARCHERS AND I TAKE NO CREDIT FOR THAT CODE.

1. sudo apt install gcc
2. sudo apt install git
3. sudo apt install cmake
4. sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi

THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES 3 FUNCTIONS:
1. Create a basic API for the micro:bit LED display
2. Create a basic API for the external OLED display provided
3. Create a graphing application on the OLED display
   a. Accelerometer Mode
   b. Jerk Mode
